The file /laravel-vercel-app/laravel-vercel-app/app/Http/Middleware is intended to contain middleware classes. Since no specific middleware class has been requested, I will create a default middleware class as an example.

Here are the contents for the file:

<?php

namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;

class ExampleMiddleware
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        // Perform some action before the request is handled

        return $next($request);
    }
}

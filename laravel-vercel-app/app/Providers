The file /laravel-vercel-app/laravel-vercel-app/app/Providers is intended to contain service provider classes. Since you haven't specified a particular service provider to create, I will provide the contents for a default `AppServiceProvider.php` file, which is commonly included in Laravel applications.

Here are the contents for the file:

<?php

namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register()
    {
        // Register any application services.
    }

    public function boot()
    {
        // Bootstrap any application services.
    }
}
